I want to use these:
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp

In this slide show:
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp


I want the slide show to be about defendants in Perry Mason episodes.
Each card will contain the following:

Picture of the actor
Name of actor
A description of the crime that includes the name of the episode.

The first card should be like a title card that describes the Perry Mason show and the subject of the slide show.

Need some test data.

It's working with just the images.  I need to make the images all the same height. 


	8:58 AM 4/23/2022

500 pixels will be the standard height of all pics.
300 pixel width.

Still way too big for my laptop screen.

Try 300 x 300 pixels.


	9:44 AM 4/23/2022

Totally works.  Just need to add 5 more clients.
And play the theme song.

Make all the pictures 300 x 300 pixels.
