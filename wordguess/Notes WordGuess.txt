Need to add this div to display logic:

<div id="kb">

var ewKb;
follow logic of ewPuzzle


	6:58 AM 4/3/2022

Replace this:

    <label for="wInput">Type a Letter and Press Enter:</label>
    <input type="text" id="wInput" name="wInput" maxlength="1" size="1" onchange="letterGuess()">

With a new function called kbPressed('Q')

ewInput = document.getElementById('wInput');


Line commented out all wInput references.


Replace the alert boxes with this message p:

<p id="pMessage">.</p>
var epMessage;

Bug list:

After you receive this message:
Congratulations! You solved the puzzle with a score of 220!!!
And before you press the play again button you can still enter letters and change your score.  Need to block this.
The fix is here:

kbPressed('Z')


var kbBlocked = false;


Fixed.  All known bugs are fixed.
