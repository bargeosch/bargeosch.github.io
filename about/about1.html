        <p>This site is where I test my projects.  This is not a portfolio website.  
        There is no theme or overall design principle.  I'll add stuff here as I think of it.

        I have only tested with Chrome on Windows and Android.  I apologize in advance for any bugs on this site.

        This website makes noise so adjust the volume and put in your ear things.  
        If you are bothered by flashing lights you should leave this website.

        <p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
