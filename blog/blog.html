        <p>I posted this website to GitHub.  I had to make several changes.</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>I had to drop the Call of Duty Mobile videos.  They took up all my space.</li>
                <li>The Sudoku Solver stopped working - I think for an expired api key.  I dropped it.</li>
                <li>I dropped most of the entries for Green Lips due to space constraints.</li> 
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I have a general problem with the appearance of the site on mobile web.  I'm working on it.</p>

        <p>I don't play Sudoku but I added a Sudoku solver.</p>
        <p>I wanted experience in using a Web API.  So I implemented this API:  
            <a href="https://rapidapi.com/adhicdm-V-hoiUpTlf8/api/sudoku-solver3/" target="_blank">sudoku-solver3.</a>
        </p>
        <p>This API is hosted on rapidapi.com.  There is a lot of cool stuff on this site.  I plan to explore it further.</p>
        <p>
            I learned from this excellent video:  <a href="https://youtu.be/WDwhJNbWka0" target="_blank">5 API Projects in 5 hours by Ania Kubow.</a>

        <p>I enjoy ancient television.  One of my favorites is Perry Mason.  I wanted to implement a side scrolling slide show.</p>
        <p>
            The music you hear was written by Frederick Steiner and performed 
            by Terence Blanchard from the Official Soundtrack of HBOs Perry Mason.

            Word Guess Game is supposed to be a mash-up between Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune.  Trivia questions where you can 
            determine the answer by guessing the letters.  Give it a try to see what I mean.
        </p>
        <p>
            FYI - This game uses a cookie to remember your score and what puzzles you've solved.  
            I set the cookie expiration date for 2 days.  After that you lose your progress.
            Sorry.

            I learned how to create an array of objects from a JSON file coding this program.

            Unexpected is an audio-visual of a song I wrote awhile ago.  
            I wanted to experiment with two JavaScript canvas objects each with their own animations that
            display on top of each other.  I think this makes it easier to apply different effects in the 
            same animation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice the fading trails on the blue dots.  This effect is not applied to the yellow portion of the animation.

            I am addicted to Call of Duty Mobile.  
            I will post videos of my matches here - but only the ones where I win MVP!
            There will be a different video every day.

            Added Green Lips to this site.  I originally thought this would be its 
            own website but I got bored creating content for it so I threw it in here.

            All of the music was created by me using <a href="https://lmms.io/" target="_blank">LMMS</a>.

            If you're interested in hearing more of 
            my music visit my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/qwirl-music/tracks" target="_blank">Soundcloud channel</a>.  
            I release music under the name QWiRL.  (It's a long story.)
